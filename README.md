Genny is a Bot boilerplate created from another bot boilerplate: [Violet](https://github.com/janicescm/Violet-Open-Source)

## installation
Genny runs on node and uses npm and the discord.io library. Don't forget to do the correct installs ```npm i```

## setup
Most of the code is functional, however you must add your own bot token to auth.js and enter some ids in the code.

## running the bot
you can run the bot by running index.js with node ```node index.js```
